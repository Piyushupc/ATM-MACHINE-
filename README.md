 * ATMMachine
Description
ATMMachine is a simple simulation of an ATM machine implemented in Python. It allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. This project serves as an example of basic object-oriented programming concepts and user interaction through the command line.

Features
Check balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Input validation and error handling

Code Overview
The ATMMachine class provides the core functionality of the ATM. The main function serves as the entry point and handles user interaction.

ATMMachine Class
python
Copy code
class ATMMachine:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.balance = initial_balance
    
    def check_balance(self):
        return f"Your current balance is ${self.balance:.2f}"
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            return f"${amount:.2f} deposited successfully. {self.check_balance()}"
        else:
            return "Invalid deposit amount. Please try again."
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            return "Invalid withdrawal amount. Please try again."
        elif amount > self.balance:
            return "Insufficient funds. Please try again."
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            return f"${amount:.2f} withdrawn successfully. {self.check_balance()}"
main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    atm = ATMMachine(100)  # Initial balance is set to $100
    print("Welcome to the ATM Machine!")
    
    while True:
        print("\nPlease choose an option:")
        print("1. Check Balance")
        print("2. Deposit Money")
        print("3. Withdraw Money")
        print("4. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            print(atm.check_balance())
        elif choice == '2':
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
            print(atm.deposit(amount))
        elif choice == '3':
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
            print(atm.withdraw(amount))
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
